      Corporate Social Responsibility
    </h2>
    <div className="k">
    Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a self-regulatory procedure that reflects a 
    business organizationâ€™s accountability to contribute to the well-being of society and 
    communities through environmental and social measures. Business organizations use CSR to 
    improve economies, environments, and societies. <br /> <br />
    A company considers CSR as a management concept for integrating multiple concerns 
    into business operations and stakeholder interactions. The comprehensive social 
    responsibility policy helps companies undertake multiple social and environmental measures, 
    contribute a part of their profits, and introduce initiatives for societal benefits. <br /> <br />
    Companies can adopt CSR policies to address the following aspects. <br />
    <ul>
        <li>Environmental management</li>
        <li>Responsible sourcing</li>
        <li>Labor standards and working conditions</li>
        <li>Stakeholder engagement policies</li>
        <li>Gender balance</li>
        <li>Social equity</li>
        <li>Good governance</li>
        <li>Human rights</li>
        <li>Anti-corruption measures</li>
        <li>Employee and community relations</li> 
    </ul> <br /> <br />
    CSR evolved from the voluntary choices of a few organizations but 
    has become the need of the hour to address environmental and social issues. 
    That is why many companies introduce mandatory regulations and legal requirements 
    to abide by the rules related to CSR policy. <br /> <br />
    At Bliss Info Systems, we have implemented a CSR policy keeping in mind the interests of society.
     We try to give more to the environment and society through our unique initiatives. Our team members 
     leave no stone unturned in contributing to the growth and development of humanity. We have introduced
      a few mandatory regulations to ensure every employee abides by them when serving the interests of our 
      society at large.
