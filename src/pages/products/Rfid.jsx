                <h2>Walkie Talkie</h2>
                The Walkie-Talkie is a high-quality, long-range connecting
                device. It can connect you and your friends up to 1 mile away!
                The Walkie-Talkie has up to 99 channels to choose from, so you
                can easily stay in touch with your friends and family. With this
                walkie-talkie, you no longer have to worry about battery life—it
                has an 8-12 hour battery life to stay connected all day long!
                <br /> <br />
                The Walkie-Talkie has a radio frequency of 400-512 MHz and works
                with up to 99 channels, so you'll never have trouble staying in
                touch with your group or family. This walkie-talkie also has a
                frequency of operation at around 400-512 MHz, which means it
                will work anywhere in the world. <br /> <br />
                <b>Specialities</b> <br /> <br />
                The walkie-talkie is the perfect companion for any outdoor
                adventure. It's waterproof and dustproof so that you can take it
                with you anywhere—the beach, camping trips, or hiking through
                the woods. When used with a clear line of sight, it has a range
                of one mile, so there's no need to worry about your connection
                getting cut off by trees or other obstacles. And the noise
                reduction feature means that even if you're in the middle of
                nowhere and surrounded by birds chirping or waves crashing on
                the shore, you'll still be able to hear each other.
                <br /> <br />
                <b>Design</b> <br /> <br />
                But what makes this walkie-talkie truly special is its design:
                it's lightweight and compact enough that you can fit it in your
                pocket or clip it onto your backpack without weighing yourself
                down. Plus, its sleek black color looks great with any outfit!
                <br /> <br />
                With Bluetooth connectivity, you can connect your walkie-talkie
                to your smartphone or tablet and use it as a speakerphone.
                <br /> <br />
                <b>Emergency Alerter</b> <br /> <br />
                If you're out on the trail alone or away from civilization for
                any reason, an emergency alert system is essential for staying
                safe. It will allow you to send out an SOS signal that can be
                picked up by anyone who has a compatible device nearby—from
                other hikers to rescue crews—and provide them with information
                about where you are so they can reach out and help.
                <br /> <br />
                Of course, these features would only be useful if they were
                waterproof! We've designed our products with IP67 certification
                to withstand extreme conditions like rain, snow, and submersion.
                <br /> <br />
                <b>Key Functionalities</b> <br /> <br />

                channel capacity of 16, and the typical RF output is 1 W when
                operating in low power mode, and 4 W when operating in high

                digital channels, depending on the type of channels you are
                using.
                <br /> <br />
                Once fully charged, A Walkie Talkie has a range of 1.5KM-3 KM
                depending on how many obstructions there are between your unit
